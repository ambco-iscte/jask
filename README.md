## What is JQLCLib?

**JQLCLib** is a Kotlin library for generating 
[Questions about Learners' Code](http://urn.fi/URN:ISBN:978-952-64-1768-4) (QLCs) targeting Java
code. JQLCLib aims to reframe [previous work into QLCs (Jask)](https://doi.org/10.1145/3502718.3524761) as
a library which can be integrated into existing educational programming environments
to promote program comprehension.
